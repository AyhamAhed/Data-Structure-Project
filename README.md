Martyrs Record System
Data Structure Project Martyrs Record System
â€¢ I developed a Java system using data structures including trees and linked lists) to efficiently manage records for Palestinian martyrs documented by B Tselem.
This system enables easy searching and
modification of records. By combining various data structures, I achieved optimal time and space complexity, resulting in a well-structured and bug-free codebase.
